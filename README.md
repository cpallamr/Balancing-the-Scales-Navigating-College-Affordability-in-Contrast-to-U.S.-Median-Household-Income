# Balancing the Scales Navigating College Affordability in Contrast to U.S.Median Household Income
Higher education  affordability and accessibility within the  context of socioeconomic disparities.

Project Abstract:This research tackles the urgent problem of rising tuition prices and how they affect 
accessibility in US higher education. Rising tuition has outpaced increase in household 
income over the last three decades, causing social mobility to be hampered and economic 
inequality to worsen. The suggested remedy is creating a sophisticated interactive 
dashboard that compares the growth of tuition and fees with median household income 
across different geographic locations by utilizing cloud-based infrastructure and analytics. 
With the use of transparent data visualizations and real-time analytics, this user-friendly 
platform seeks to empower stakeholders, including researchers, politicians, and students, 
to support policy changes, make informed decisions, and create a more accessible and 
affordable higher education environment. The goal of the project is to offer a special degree 
of in-depth research and openness, acting as a useful tool for students and families 
navigating the challenges of affording college as well as a potent lobbying tool for 
legislative change.

Section 1: Problem Definition

1.1 Background
Higher education is largely acknowledged as the primary factor influencing social and economic growth in the United States. The chance of students to enroll in and complete their college education has been severely limited over the course of the last thirty years by increasing educational expenses and the allocation of financial stress to students via different charges. Adding to previous inequities caused by race and socioeconomic status, this trend has caused significant obstacles for students, particularly those from low-income homes and those with limited opportunity.
Educational expenses have significantly risen in recent years. Tuition and fee hikes are directly caused by cuts in governmental financing for public educational institutions. However, private non-profit universities have also seen cost increases because of this trend, thus it is not limited to public institutions. Public universities are more cost-effective than private ones. Regarding a public university, the average full-time student at a private non-profit college spent $48,965 in 2019â€“2020, which is $21,035 higher.
The latest findings from the Georgetown University Center for Education and the Workforce reveal a stark reality - the cost of obtaining a college degree has exponentially risen in the past four decades. From past four decades, the median expenses for tuition, housing, and other associated costs have climbed by a whopping 180%. Inflation has also played a significant factor, with an item that previously cost $10,000 now equivalent to a staggering an approximate of $29,000. Income for those aged 22-27 have only grown by 19% during a 40-year period, which is insufficient to keep up with the rising cost of education. The results highlight the considerable financial obstacles faced by persons pursuing a higher degree. 
It might be difficult to guarantee the advantages of a college education because of the diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds of students nowadays. Financial limitations, increased tuition fees, and stagnating family incomes are hindrances that make it harder to fully benefit from higher education.
The increasing tuition costs create an urgent threat to the cost and availability of higher education. Therefore, students and their families, especially those from different cultures and with little financial resources, struggle to pay for college or end up overburdened with large debt. Due of the considerable obstacles that low-income, non-traditional, and students of color have historically encountered when pursuing a college degree, these groups will be most badly impacted by this. Furthermore, the increase in costs endangers not just the individual prospects of these students but also the future of entire governments and towns, which depend more and more on a workforce with higher levels of education.

1.2	Problem Space
Analysis

Economic Disparities and Barriers to Accessibility in Higher Education

The complex web of economic disparities plaguing higher education in America greatly impacts the accessibility for a sizable portion of the population. In the past four decades, the cost of attending college has risen at a significantly higher rate than the average income growth, creating major barriers for aspiring students.
Growing Expenses in Contrary to Stalling Wages

Over the past four decades, the costs associated with attending a four-year college have skyrocketed by a staggering 180%. These expenses, which encompass housing and board, tuition, and fees, have significantly outpaced the modest 19% increase in salaries for young workers aged 22 to 27 during the same time frame. As a result, students and their families are burdened with a substantial financial strain while striving to obtain a higher education.
What Is the True Cost of An Undergraduate Four-Year Degree?

Since the 1980s, the cost of attending college has steadily risen. Interestingly, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that during the 2015-2016 academic year, the typical annual expense for attending a public four-year university was a staggering $19,000. Private universities, on the other hand, come with a hefty price tag of around $40,000, which includes not only tuition and fees but also room and board.

Obtaining a college degree has become increasingly costly. As a result, the majority of non-mortgage debt in the United States is now made up of student loans, exceeding the combined amount of personal loans and credit card debt.
What could be the reason behind the hikes?

One contributing factor is the policies of colleges and universities, as well as reductions in state funding. As state financial support for public institutions decreases, students and their families are left with a larger financial burden, leading to higher tuition fees. This trend is not limited to public institutions, as private non-profit colleges also have a high cost of attendance, further worsening the issue of affordability.
The Requirement for Competent Solutions

In order to effectively combat the challenges within this problem domain, a data-driven approach is essential. We must have access to high-quality tools and platforms that are capable of comprehensively evaluating, visually presenting, and effectively communicating the disparities between struggling household incomes and rising college costs. These invaluable resources will play a vital role in advocating for policy change, informing institutional improvements, and ultimately promoting greater accessibility to higher education for all members of our society.
