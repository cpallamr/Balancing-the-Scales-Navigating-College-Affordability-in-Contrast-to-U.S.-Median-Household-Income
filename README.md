# TEAM KAIZEN (Balancing the Scales Navigating College Affordability in Contrast to U.S.Median Household Income)
Higher education  affordability and accessibility within the  context of socioeconomic disparities.

Project Abstract:This research tackles the urgent problem of rising tuition prices and how they affect 
accessibility in US higher education. Rising tuition has outpaced increase in household 
income over the last three decades, causing social mobility to be hampered and economic 
inequality to worsen. The suggested remedy is creating a sophisticated interactive 
dashboard that compares the growth of tuition and fees with median household income 
across different geographic locations by utilizing cloud-based infrastructure and analytics. 
With the use of transparent data visualizations and real-time analytics, this user-friendly 
platform seeks to empower stakeholders, including researchers, politicians, and students, 
to support policy changes, make informed decisions, and create a more accessible and 
affordable higher education environment. The goal of the project is to offer a special degree 
of in-depth research and openness, acting as a useful tool for students and families 
navigating the challenges of affording college as well as a potent lobbying tool for 
legislative change.
